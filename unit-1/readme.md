# Frontend Personal Project

The goal of this project is to put what you've learned to use to:

* [Create a project proposal and get it approved by an instructor](#proposal)
* [Create and deploy a web app](#create-deploy)
* [Present your work to the class](#present)

<a id="proposal"></a>

## Create a project proposal and get it approved by an instructor

Your proposal should have

* A project description
    * Who uses it?
    * What outputs do they need?
    * What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?
* A list of technologies that you plan to use
* A well-defined and written-out feature list

There are some constraints around what technologies MUST be present in your app. Check out [Create and deploy a web app](#create-deploy) below.

### Sample Ideas

* Games are always popular. A Tetris Game, a blackjack game, a battleship game, a [space shooter](http://mmarsella.github.io/Block-Blaster/), a [Pac-Man clone](https://dogparkapp.herokuapp.com/game), etc. 
* A quiz to test your JavaScript knowledge.
* A food library, similar to the [Game Library](https://github.com/gSchool/g11-course-curriculum/tree/master/week05/05_exercises/js-game-library), to keep track of your daily caloric/nutrition intake.
* A documentation aggregator that allows developers to easily search through documentation.
* A flash card style interview prep tool.
* A ping-pong scheduling/scoring system.
* A [Sudoku Solver](http://mherman.org/sudoku-solver/).
* Like music? Here's a [guitar chord practicing tool](http://shastings517.github.io/chordRep/).

## Create and deploy a web app

Your web app should:

* HTML
    * Make good use of semantic HTML tags
    * Be well-indented, [validated](https://validator.w3.org/nu/), etc.
    * Include some embedded media (images, audio, video, canvas)
    * Optionally, use a templating engine
* CSS
    * Use your own style rules, in combination with a styling framework like Bootstrap
        * If you are using Bootstrap, please consider theming with something like bootswatch, or a [customizer](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/)
    * Be well-indented and clean
    * Split code into separate files where appropriate
    * Responsive design optional but strongly encouraged
* JavaScript
    * DOM manipulation via JavaScript or jQuery
    * Integration with some external API via XHR or AJAX
    * Response to some user-initiated events
    * Well-indented, [linted](http://www.javascriptlint.com/online_lint.php), and use excellent variable names
    * Split code into separate files where appropriate
    * Optionally, use a test-driven development approach
* User Input
    * Use at least one web form
    * Validate user input
    * Optionally, persist user data using something like LocalStorage
* Workflow
    * Use wireframes to create your layouts before you build them
    * Use a feature-branch workflow for your user stories

## Present your work to the class

* Be prepared to spend ~5 minutes presenting your work to the class on Friday. 
* On Thursday, be prepared to go through a practice run of your presentation with an instructor.
* Your presentation should describe what the project is, the technologies you used, and some information about the workflow you followed.
* Make a Pull Request against this repository with a link to your project in `unit-1/projects.md`.

This is essentially a mini-capstone, as is a really good preview of how your final projects will go. This is a Big Deal Week, and you should put maximum effort into making it successful. You can and should use your classmates and your instructors as learning resources, but this should be your own work.
